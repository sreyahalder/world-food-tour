Afterwards she was telling us about her son and how he's a realtor (?) gave us his card."

It's an Argentine deli/market that's got black and white tiled floors, a butcher counter with probably the finest meats in LA, football on the TVs, and servers who kept thinking we speak Spanish. We started with bread and chimichurri and finished with glasses of Merlot, and had an amazing cut of steak in between. Why is it our favorite? I don't think you can beat really good steak."

However, the star of the show was the chicken liver pates we had as a little amouse bouche, even though they aren't really Austrian."

This spot doubled as a market and a restaurant, and it was all a buffet style except for the fresh parathas they would make you upon request. I think I had just gotten back from India a few weeks before we went, so I was freshly fluent in Bengali and got to show off a bit (I definitely sounded like an idiot). We tried quite a few things that I liked to eat growing up, but none were honestly as good as what my mom and grandmas would make."

But turns out there was a Clippers vs. Knicks game one night that ended up being the perfect excuse. I think this spot made me realize how cool of an experience this series is. I wasn't planning on going to Belize anytime soon, but getting to try the really unique street foods from this country in the comfort of our own city is a really fascinating feeling."
